# Mimi-s-Beauty-Parlour
This is a one page static and responsive website. It is quite simple and basic. No libraries and frameworks have been used.
Mimi's beauty parlour has been built solely for learning purposes but feel free to do with it what you like. Just remember to share with us what you have come up with from it or what you have learnt. That will totally make our day better.

This is a one page website using only html and internal css. This is probably the simplest web design can get.
